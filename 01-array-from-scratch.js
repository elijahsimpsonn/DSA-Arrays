// Implement an Array class from scratch.

// Walk through each step of implementing an array. 
// Don't rush through this by copying and pasting the code samples. 
// After you've walked through it and you understand the code of the Array class, 
// Hide the sample code and try writing the Array class from scratch using the memory module for allocating memory.
// Be sure to export the memory module and then import it using require.
